# PyTrackDat â€” A pipeline for online data collection and management

## Overview

PyTrackDat comprises two Python scripts that analyze and assist in converting
data and relevant metadata from `.csv` files into an online database that can
facilitate data management, manipulation, and quality control. What each of
these scripts does is outlined in this `README.md` file. Note that the care
that is taken to assemble `.csv` files before using these scripts will help
ensure that the database generated is maximally useful.


## Documentation

The latest documentation is available on

## Notes

### Using Spatialite for GIS on macOS

To use Spatialite on macOS, it is suggested that `brew` is used to install
the `spatialite-tools` and `gdal` packages.

The built-in `python3` that ships with macOS does not have extension support
enabled, and thus cannot be used to build the PyTrackDat site.
