## Overview

PyTrackDat comprises two Python scripts that analyze and assist in converting
data and relevant metadata from `.csv` files into an online database that can
facilitate data management, manipulation, and quality control. What each of
these scripts does is outlined in this `README.md` file. Note that the care
that is taken to assemble `.csv` files before using these scripts will help
ensure that the database generated is maximally useful.
