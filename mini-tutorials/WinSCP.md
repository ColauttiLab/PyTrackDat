# WinSCP Mini Tutorial for PyTrackDat Setup

TODO: DOWNLOAD

Once WinSCP has been downloaded, double click it to open it. It will show a
window for logging into a server.

For the host name, enter the IP address of the droplet (or the server) being
accessed. For the username and password, use the username and password used to
remotely log into the droplet or server. Then, click Login.

The main window will now be in focus. WinSCP will show a listing of files on
the remote server as well. If the droplet or server is newly created, there
may not be any files visible yet.

In the left-hand pane, locate the ZIP file containing your site using the
location dropdown and popup menus (in the screenshot, `G: KINGSTON` is the
location and `site_name.zip` is the ZIP file in question) and press the Upload
button.

The ZIP file is now on the server! You can exit out of WinSCP and proceed with
unzipping and setting up the PyTrackDat application.
